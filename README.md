# Particles sea

To use the script, connect the index.js to your index.html file, and add the <canvas id="canvas" /> tag.

To run locally just open index.html in your browser.

The main feature is waves that move particles around the canvas. Waves can be enabled and disabled.
It uses a lot of performance since the current complexity is p * w (where p is the number of particles and w is the number of waves). But looks cool.

You can enable mouse interaction with particles by toggling values in CONFIG. Mouse interaction has three modes: OFF, ATTRACTION, and REPULSION. It's pretty self-explanatory what these modes do.
